        Blue Pride was launched in October 2013 and membership grew to over 100 within the first year. Since then, Blue Pride has been making amazing progress. From LGBT-specific recruiting events to adding gender expression to their EEO along with sexual orientation and gender identity, Blue Pride has done in three years what has taken other ERGs decades.
        In Their Own Words: “Only 407 companies world-wide earned a 100% on the 2016 HRC CEI; there are many, many more companies out there like us with newer ERGs, and Blue Pride is proof that starting late doesn’t mean you can’t be impactful.”
