From LGBT-specific recruiting events to adding gender expression to their EEO along with sexual orientation and gender identity, Blue Pride has done in three years what has taken other ERGs decades."

Since its formation in 1996, ANGLE has held a variety of visibility and awareness events throughout each year, especially during annual June Pride month celebrations. These efforts were amped up between 2010 and 2015 when larger societal changes and a push for greater diversity and inclusion at the CIA allowed ANGLE to advance major initiatives."

The group not only supports IBMâ€™s global strategies in diversity and inclusion through recruitment, talent retention, talent development, and market development, but has also become an informal support group by giving LGBTQ employees and allies a sense of community."
